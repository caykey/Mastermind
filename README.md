# Mastermind Game
Mastermind, a game where you enter `(R)ed`, `(O)range`, `(Y)ellow`, `(G)reen`, `(B)lue` or `(P)urple`.

You get a response with either `Black` or `White`, black being in the right place and white being in the string.

You don't need to install any PIP things and the game is played in console.

## How to Run
Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then open the file with Python, very epic.
